lightcase.js
======

The smart and flexible Lightbox Plugin.

Lightcase is a flexible and extendable web application to present various media formats on your website and is based on the jQuery Framework.
All information, documentation and developer guidelines are available on the [official lightcase plugin website](
http://cornel.bopp-art.com/lightcase/).

Grunt build setup by Mauro Trigo.

```grunt build```

I forked this repo because I needed a minified and joined CSS file for lightcase.js. **There are no improvements to the original lightcase.js plugin**

Install with bower:

```bower install mauro-lightcase```
